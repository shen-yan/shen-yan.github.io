Here are some of my past projects


# Probability and Simulation

[01. Roulette Simulation](https://shen-yan.github.io/Probability-and-Inference-Portfolio-Shen-Yan-/blob/master/01-roulette-simulation/writeup.html)
  Use simulation to see if using Martingale Strategy will improve one's winning while playing Roulette.

[02. Simulation Error](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/shen-yan/Probability-and-Inference-Portfolio-Shen-Yan-/blob/master/02-monte-carlo-error/writeup.html)
  Examines the effects of sample size on accuracy of calculation results by measurements of absolute and relative errors.

[03. Probability Calculation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/shen-yan/Probability-and-Inference-Portfolio-Shen-Yan-/blob/master/03-probability-calcs/writeup.html)
