## Welcome to Yan's Website

Here are some of my past projects


# Probability and Simulation

[01. Roulette Simulation](https://shen-yan.github.io/Probability-and-Inference-Portfolio-Shen-Yan-/01-roulette-simulation/writeup.html)

  Use simulation to see if using Martingale Strategy will improve one's winning while playing Roulette.

[02. Simulation Error](https://shen-yan.github.io/Probability-and-Inference-Portfolio-Shen-Yan-/02-monte-carlo-error/writeup.html)

  Examines the effects of sample size on accuracy of calculation results by measurements of absolute and relative errors.

[03. Probability Calculation](https://shen-yan.github.io/Probability-and-Inference-Portfolio-Shen-Yan-/03-probability-calcs/writeup.html)

  Examines the basic concepts of probability theories through simulation.

[04. Home Field Advantage](https://shen-yan.github.io/Probability-and-Inference-Portfolio-Shen-Yan-/04-home-field-advantage/writeup.html)

  Examines the concept of conditional probability through simulation.

[05. Quantile Error](https://shen-yan.github.io/Probability-and-Inference-Portfolio-Shen-Yan-/05-quantile-error/writeup.html)

  Which quantiles of a continuous distribution can one estimate with more precision?

[06. Order Statistics](https://shen-yan.github.io/Probability-and-Inference-Portfolio-Shen-Yan-/06-order-statistics/writeup.html)

  Introduced the concept of order statistics and their distributions.

[08. Coverage Probability](https://shen-yan.github.io/Probability-and-Inference-Portfolio-Shen-Yan-/08-coverage-probability/writeup.html)

  Examines the concept of coverage probability through simulation.

[09. Simulation Study](https://shen-yan.github.io/Probability-and-Inference-Portfolio-Shen-Yan-/09-simulation-study/writeup.html)

  Examines how the true underlying distribution will affect coverage probability through simulation. 

[10. Central Limit Theorem Approximation](https://shen-yan.github.io/Probability-and-Inference-Portfolio-Shen-Yan-/10-CLT-approximation/writeup.html)

  Examines the accuracy of the mean approximated using central limit theorem.

[11. Multivariable Normal Distribution](https://shen-yan.github.io/Probability-and-Inference-Portfolio-Shen-Yan-/11-mvn/writeup.html)

  Study the correlation between power and sample size using multivariable normal distribution.
